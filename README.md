# OBD Boost Interface
[In progress]

This is a terminal based Python program which uses a OBDII port to display the formatted intake pressure of a supercharged engine.
Inspired by seeing a friend's boost gauge extension in their Mini Cooper S, I am replicating this on an old Android smartphone.
Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 + MacOS Mojave + Android 4.3

```
- A terminal emulator 
- [Python-OBD Library](https://python-obd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation) - latest release:

```

## How To Use
